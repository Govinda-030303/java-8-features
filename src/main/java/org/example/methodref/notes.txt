the method references are a way to refer to methods or constructors without invoking them. They are a shorthand notation of a lambda expression and can be used anywhere a functional interface is expected.
The method references are denoted using ‘Class::methodName‘ type syntax

1. Types of method references:
 java allow four types of method reference:
 a. method reference to static method:
    description: used to refer to static method from class.
    syntax: className::staticMethodName
 b. method reference to instance method from a specified instance:
    description: Refer to an instance method using a reference to the supplied object
    syntax: instance::instanceMethodName
 c. method reference to instance method from the class type:
    description: Invoke the instance method on a reference to an object supplied by the context
    syntax: ClassName::instanceMethodName
 d. method reference to constructor:
    description: Reference to a constructor
    syntax: ClassName::new

note: Please note that the method references always utilize the :: operator
